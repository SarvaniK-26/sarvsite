# Helloooooo, welcome in :)

August 18, 2025

Hello and welcome to my page! I am hoping to use this blog as a way to keep myself accountable in terms of projects, life goals, and just keeping up with the random articles and substacks. 

#### So why am I yapping??? 

1. As I began exploring topics outside the confines of a classroom, I reflected on how I used to learn as a kid. Growing up, I loved creating slideshows and summarizing random subjects—mostly because of my father. I recently realized how fun it was and, even better, how effective it was for retaining information. This is something I want to bring back into my life!

2. Just before writing this, I was looking through my artist.sarvani@gmail inbox and found emails I sent to my family in India at age 9 to keep them updated about my life. They were a mix of nostalgia, funny moments, and cringe. I hope that in years to come, I can also look back at this blog and do the same. 

#### Main Goals 
- Write, document, and explain the projects I work on. I hope to yap about the issues I ran into, what bugs I banged my head over, and solutions I build. 
- Summarize and effectively communicate about new topics I read about. I have been getting back into reading and often these books have a way of sending me into a rabbit hole especially when they are history related.
- Yap away about random life lessons I run into :) 

I don’t expect this to reach many people (and it doesn’t need to), but if you are reading this, thank you—I appreciate you.
